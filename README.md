# Portfolio
This is my software portfolio. It is a website which I build to stand out from the crowd in job applications / internships. I wanted to build a website which was creative, yet still professional. After doing some research I saw a common theme among some impressive websites. The common theme was that they weren't 2D but 3D! This made me very interested in making a portfolio in 3D. The library which I used for that is called ThreeJS. I really enjoyed this project because I could put my entire imagination into it.

### Installation
Install all packages
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
Run server
```
npm run dev
```

### What did I learn?
I learned some unexpected things, I learned quite a bit about Blender which is 3d modeling software. I also learned how to create animations in blender and rig them. I learned how to think in 3D instead of 2D, which was the biggest challenge of them all.

### What is there left to do?
I want to clean up my code by programming it Object Oriented. This will look much better and will allow me to have less code.
