# Portfolio
This is my software portfolio. It is a website which I build to stand out from the crowd in job applications / internships. I wanted to build a website which was creative, yet still professional. After doing some research I saw a common theme among some impressive websites. The common theme was that they weren't 2D but 3D! This made me very interested in making a portfolio in 3D. The library which I used for that is called ThreeJS. I really enjoyed this project because I could put my entire imagination into it.
